          <h3>Art</h3>
          <p>I mostly just do digital art. I only was really learning and improving when I was doodling in school, so now my art style will be stuck in my 16 year old self's art style for the forseeable future. I still find it fun though!</p>

          <p>I have a Huion tablet and Clip Studio Paint for when I'm at home. I also have an iPad and Apple Pencil to use with Procreate (though I get frustrated w/ Procreate since it's pretty limited.)</p>

          <h4>Beginner's tools</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>For tablets: if you already have an iPad, then trying to snag a second hand Apple Pencil for cheap is a really good idea so you can draw on the go.</li>
            <li>You can also use your PC programs with EasyCanvas if you're willing to pay a pretty cheap one time fee. This is great if you don't want to pay a subscription (ew!) for Clip Studio Paint on the iPad.</li>
            <li>Procreate is a popular paid app, but if you don't want to pay anything there are plenty of free apps - Medibang Paint, ibis Paint X, etc.</li>
            <li>If an iPad isn't possible, there are various cheap graphics tablets you can order online. There are new ones always coming out so take a look around at different reviews.</li>
            <li>You probably shouldn't splurge on a screen tablet. Get a regular one and try to get used to the feeling of drawing on it while looking at a screen.</li>
            <li>For drawing programs: Clip Studio Paint is just about the best one you can get for digital illustration. Try to catch it while it's on sale.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, there are a lot of free drawing programs you can get. Firealpaca and Medibang Paint are both light and easy to use. Krita is also a <i>very</i> detailed free art program that has a learning curve.</li>
            <li>If you can't afford any tech, you can always use pen and paper! Your notebook margins are just begging to be scribbled in.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Pole Dancing</h3>
          <p>I've been pole dancing for less than a year now and I have fallen madly in love with it already. It's pretty much the one thing in my life where I feel like I'm actually leveling up bit by bit. Now to explain why pole dancing is great and why you should do it!!</p>

          <p>(I'll uh... continue this later.)</p>
