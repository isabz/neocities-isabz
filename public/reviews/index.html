        <p>Just some thoughts on stuff I've recently seen/experienced. I think I'm quite easy to please when it comes to a lot of things, so don't expect any thoughtful critique!</p>

        <p>Recently I've actually started playing some of the games from those massive itch.io fundraiser bundles, so that's what I'm starting off with.  Prepare for a <i>lot</i> of self-indulgent visual novels...</p>
        
        <p>If you also have those bundles and are feeling a bit overwhelmed, <a href="https://randombundlegame.com/">this</a> website is quite useful.</p>

        <p><a href="https://laburatory.itch.io/lgd"><b>Long Gone Days</b></a></p>

        <p>I actually played it as soon as I got my first of these massive itch.io bundles. I kind of fell hopelessly in love with it. I wish there could be more RPGs like this. Only problem is I moved to a new computer and lost my save files (T_T) I'll wait until the full release comes out to replay it all.</p>
        <p>It's exactly what it says on the tin: "<i>Modern-day RPG that imagines the world of war that's coming for us, with a focus on civilians and language barriers.</i>" I'd really urge you to check this one out even if you don't think you'd like it. Just looking at the screenshots on the game page is making my heart yearn ü§ç</p>

        <p>Early 2000s fangirl nostalgia! Neocities will like this one I think. I'm a couple hours into it and it's very charming. Occasionally I get confused on what to do but it's not very often. Right now I don't think I've quite gotten into the meat of the story yet, but it's still fun. If you like games that are mostly just reading, and have some nostalgia for old rp communities, this one's for you.</p>

        <p>This one's pretty popular already, and I can see why. It's very smart but very easy to understand. Maybe it could benefit from letting you know just how much you can alter the rules since I got confused about that a couple times. I've gotten stuck on like the second world though... I'll come back to it later!! It's fine!!</p>
