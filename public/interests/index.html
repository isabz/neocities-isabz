          <h1>Anime</h1>
          <p>I've been watching anime for as long as I can remember! There's probably a bunch I've forgotten that I watched when I was younger, or that I watched while they were airing, and they just haven't come back to me yet. So, this list isn't even slightly exhaustive. Also, I might include donghua since I haven't watched enough to make it it's own separate list. I hope you look one of these up and fall madly in love. The criteria includes: "I watched it and thought it was alright", and nothing else! In no particular order: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Tokyo Mew Mew</li>
            <li>Soul Eater</li>
            <li>Fullmetal Alchemist (2003 and Brotherhood)</li>
            <li>Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica</li>
            <li>Hunter x Hunter</li>
            <li>Neon Genesis Evangelion</li>
            <li>Death Note</li>
            <li>Erased</li>
            <li>Kekkai Sensen</li>
            <li>Bungou Stray Dogs</li>
            <li>Made in Abyss</li>
            <li>Great Pretender</li>
            <li>Land of the Lustrous</li>
            <li>Beastars</li>
            <li>Toilet-bound Hanako-kun</li>
            <li>Shadows House</li>
            <li>Link Click</li>
            <li>All Saints Street</li>
            <li>Demon Slayer</li>
            <li>Fire Force</li>
            <li>The Promised Neverland</li>
            <li>Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song</li>
            <li>Id: Invaded</li>
            <li>Moriarty The Patriot</li>
            <li>To your Eternity</li>
            <li>Jujutsu Kaisen</li>
            <li>Akudama Drive</li>
            <li>The Case Study of Vanitas</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>If you have any recommendations for me after looking through this, let me know </p>
          <p>I'm interested in creepy-cute things like Hanako-kun and Shadows House, jazzy cool street-level things like Great Pretender, and magical girl anime. (I've probably heard of most of the famous stuff, but try me anyway)</p>
          
          <h1>Comics/Manga/Webtoons</h1>
          
          <p>I haven't read too many western comics that aren't webcomics. My current favourite webcomics are probably Paranatural and The Boy Who Fell. I think I prefer webtoons for how accessible they are, I'm subscribed to a couple on the app.</p>
          
          <p>As for manga, I also don't read them a lot unless I hear of one that particularly vibes with me, or I really need to know what happens after the end of an anime when I know it's not gonna get another season. My current favourite might be Witch Hat Atelier. When it comes to reading manga and webcomics, I'll read all of what's out all in one go, forget about it for a few months, then come back and catch up on what's left. So assume I'm not up to date on anything!!</p>
          
          <p>Anyway, please let me know your favourite comics and manga ~</p>
