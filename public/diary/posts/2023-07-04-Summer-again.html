      <p>It's summer again! It's been a while, hasn't it? I've noticed that I'm much more prone to working on this site when I actually have an abundance of free time. I don't think I'll be forgetting about this site anytime soon, though. :P I'll keep adding bits and pieces here and there.</p>

      <p>Anyhow, I managed to get through the year!! o(â‰§âˆ€â‰¦)o At times I seriously wondered about deferring, or if I was gonna be kicked out... But I got through it, and did fairly well grade-wise! If I wanna get a 1st I'll have to push myself in my last year, but it's definitely possible. I have no idea if my project is even gonna work out given my tiny brain, but miracles happen all the time with my schoolwork. I even got a summer internship - of course, it was one of the last ones I applied for and the only one to give me an offer ã€’â–½ã€’</p>

      <p>I found comfort in places I thought I wouldn't. Recently, when I was having trouble with talking down my anxiety, I pulled out some tarot cards (I know, I don't believe in them but I just think they're really pretty) and did a reading. It's sort of meditative, I guess? I don't know if a therapist would recommend it, but I found that it helped me take a step back from the situation and be a bit kinder to those around me. I sorta want to keep learning tarot, just for fun and in case it helps me again.</p>

      <br>

      <p>I don't think there's a better time to have a personal website, honestly, it seems like a lot of social medias are being pushed to their breaking point. (psst, if you wanna find me on Mastodon, currently I'm <a href="https://sakurajima.moe/@isabz">@isabz@sakurajima.moe</a>) My only concern is, I want there to be more places specifically made for artists, not where they're more of an afterthought to text and video. Basically, I kinda wish I was more involved in the heyday of DeviantArt. ArtStation seems to be more of a portfolio site than anything, and I like the vibes of toyhou.se but it seems to be more of a place for storing and trading characters/worlds and doing roleplay. The obvious place would be Pixelfed, but it looks more like an Instagram clone ðŸ¤®</p>

      <p>Anyway the best place to read comics is definitely on people's websites! I've been keeping up with <a href="https://whathappensnext.webcomic.ws/">what happens next</a> and it's absolutely riveting. No other comics currently come to mind, but I'm always open to recommendations. I like comics that have an ending in sight, as opposed to the grand epics we all dream of making but never finish (Â¬_Â¬") Also, it's been a while since I browsed through the "recently updated" part of neocities, I bet there's a whole bunch of new sites popping up what with the current chaos going on. Maybe it's been long enough that the new sites have a fair amount of content already? (not that I have any room to speak on that)</p>

      <p>I'm cautiously optimistic for the future, if not for myself then for everyone else who's beginning to grow tired of the current internet culture of keeping everything to like 3 corporate websites. Seeya later! ãƒ¾(ï¿£â–½ï¿£) </p>
