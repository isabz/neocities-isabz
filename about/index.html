          <p>Hello! Honestly I'm just your typical loser over here on neocities. I have a billion different hobbies that are always changing, but I love all of them. There are a whole load of anime I like, and a bunch more I need to get around to actually watching (￣_￣|||)</p>
          <p>I like horror in theory but in practice I'm such a wimp I have to spend days recovering from watching a horror movie, even terrible ones. For some reason I'm really into creepy cute aesthetics - if you know of any shows in the same vein as Toilet Bound Hanako-kun or Shadows House, please let me know!!</p>
          <p>I have a big problem with starting series or games and then never finishing them. I just get really excited about every new thing I see...</p>
